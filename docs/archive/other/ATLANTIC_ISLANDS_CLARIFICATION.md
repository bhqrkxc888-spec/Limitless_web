- 🇵🇹 **Madeira** (Portugal)
- 🇵🇹 **Azores** (Portugal)
- 🇨🇻 **Cape Verde**

**Slug:** `atlantic-islands-cruises`
**This is CORRECT and staying grouped together!**

## Why Grouped Together?

✅ These islands are often sold together on the same itineraries
✅ Similar appeal: volcanic landscapes, year-round sun, island hopping
✅ Easier to manage (one destination page instead of 3-4)
✅ Canaries are the main draw, with mentions of the others
