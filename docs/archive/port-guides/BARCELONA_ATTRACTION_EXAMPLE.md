## Example Expected Output (What we need from Perplexity):

### La Sagrada Familia
**Description:** Gaudí's iconic, still-unfinished basilica is Barcelona's most famous landmark. The interior is breathtaking with coloured light filtering through stained glass, and the facades tell biblical stories in stone. This is an absolute must-see for first-time visitors to Barcelona.

**Duration:** 2 to 3 hours for a relaxed pace

**Tips:**
1. Book skip-the-line tickets online at least 48 hours in advance, especially during cruise season (April to October)
2. Visit at opening time (9am) to avoid the worst crowds and catch the best morning light inside
3. Consider adding the tower climb for spectacular city views, but book this separately as it sells out

**Highlights:** Architecture, Photography, History, Art, UNESCO World Heritage, Religious site

**Good for:** First-time visitors, Architecture lovers, Photographers, Families, Art enthusiasts

1. Book timed entry tickets online in advance, they sell out most days in cruise season
2. Take a taxi up the hill and walk down afterwards to save energy

**Duration:** 2 to 3 hours for a relaxed pace (including interior visit to one building)

**Tips:**
1. Choose one building to enter (Casa Batlló or La Pedrera) rather than trying both on a port day
2. Book tickets online in advance to skip the long entrance queues

**Duration:** 2.5 to 3.5 hours for a relaxed pace

**Tips:**
1. Take the cable car up for views, then explore the castle and gardens before taking a bus or taxi down
2. The Magic Fountain shows run evenings (not during cruise port stops) but the area is worth visiting by day
3. Combine with one or two attractions on the hill (castle, MNAC museum, Olympic area) rather than trying to see everything
